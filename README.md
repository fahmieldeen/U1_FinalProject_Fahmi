<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This is an interactive art/game called CODID (Cats Only Dance In the Dark), the tile explains the art itself,
the cat will only dance when it is dark, and will be extremely shocked when you turn on the lights. The music will also stop playing 
because this cat has really good reflexes with turning off his speakers. My game can basically be displayed with 3 screenshots. <p>
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
I was inspired by my very weird attraction towards cats, and music.
